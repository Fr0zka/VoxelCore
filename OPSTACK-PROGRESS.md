## 2026-07-27 — branch created, design locked, nothing built

**What:** Branch `experimental` created from `69fa73e tmp` and checked out. `main` untouched and is the
known-good fallback world. Design finalised across `OPSTACK-PLAN.md` (incl. §2.5 op taxonomy and §2.6
acceptance bar, both added after Jahni's objection that a naive "ops" reading would just be his old
room-operations system). Kickoff prompt written to `OPSTACK-PROMPT.md`.

**Believed true:** the plugin builds and runs correctly as of this commit — everything through F20
phases 1+2 is built and working (confirmed by Jahni 2026-07-26; the "PENDING BUILD" markers still in
`fable-idea.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` are stale and are queue item Q3). `bEnableDensityVolume` is already
set to false. Lighting is deprecated for now. Live direction before this refactor was 3D density
generation (overhangs, caves inside mountains).

**UNVERIFIED:** nothing yet — no code has been written for this refactor.

**Known open bugs, not yet fixed, documented in `AUDIT-2026-07.md §1`:** C1 large-seed noise collapse ·
C2 three cache keys missing `LayoutVersion` · C3 `FMath::PerlinNoise2D` on the SDF hot path (dormant) ·
C4 `GetPlayerPosition` zero-vector sentinel · C5 unbounded-join-on-shutdown · C6 diff-layer scaling.

**Next single action:** Phase 0.5 — the three automation tests (density purity across worker threads,
`ClassifyTile` vs brute force, `DiffLayer` under contention). Then the Phase 1 skeleton header only.
Then STOP for a build. See `OPSTACK-PROMPT.md` → `WHAT TO DO`.
